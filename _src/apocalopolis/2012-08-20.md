<div id="longdesc">
    <p>A young girl, about 8 years of age, wearing a backpack and a pleated skirt, walks along a path with trees and shrubs about and mountains in the distance behind. She laughs, loudly as she hold the hand of a doll of some sort. "Heh heh!"</p>
    <p>The girl says, "did you get a look at his <strong>face</strong> when he realized we <strong>scammed</strong> him <strong>good</strong>?"</p>
    <p>Her doll doesn't react, it's face frozen still in a sort of mechanical smile, with a star on it's chest.</p>
    <p>"I know, right?," cries out the girl with glee, as if the doll had said something, and in her excitement she raised her arms, pulling the doll up into the air in a great arc.</p>
    <p>The girl dismissively says, "pffft!," as a dark cloud suddenly appears in the distance and draws neared.</p>
    <p>The girl's incredulous words ring out before the enveloping darkness takes over the scene. "A <strong>cloud</strong> monst'r? <strong>Ha!</strong>"</p>
